## Word of Caution

- Commerical use is allowed by the clauses in the LICENSE, however refrain to extort money from ill-informed undegraduate students through the materials provided here.
- This course is **NOT** the be-all and end-all for learning classical non-deep Machine Learning. There are 100s of courses and 1000s of universities and creators who offer superior material and experience. Please be aware of anyone trying to persuade you this otherwise with intentions to encash your ignorance.
- The course was offered in Feb 2020 for free just before the pandemic set in India. The creators involved here wish to keep it that way :)
